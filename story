Once upon a time there was Crow. He was very thirsty. He was searching for water everywhere.
Then he saw a pot. He went closer to check if there was any watre in it. To his surprise, there was a little bit of water
at the bottom of the pot. But, he could not reach it. The Crow then saw a few stones and got an idea. He quickly started picking up
the stones and he started dropping them one by one into the pot. The water level in the pot came up and he happily drank the
water and flew off!
